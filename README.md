This is the AGL documentation repository.

Find the documentation files (.md format) in the docs folder.

Tools used to generate parts of the documentation are in the doctools folder.


A simple way to browse the documentation is to install mkdocs (pip install mkdocs)
and call 'mkdocs serve' and open a browser at http://localhost:8000 .
This is perfect for local development.


There is also publishing system based on jekyll that is developed in the
doctools/webdoc-tools folder with the templates being kept in webdocs-agl.
